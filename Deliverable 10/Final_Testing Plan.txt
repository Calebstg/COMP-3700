Plan:
1: Review of the use case model

2: Make sure that our use case logically clear and the system is perfomed well

3: Inspect the normal workflow in the system, which will also check the integrity of our APP's functions.

4: Make sure that each use case is testable, our payment option like paypal and credit card are not testable because of the security reason.

5: After all above steps checked, we are ready to make the test case.

6: The test cases for each normal flow (i.e. login, items list and customer choosing etc.)

7: We compare our use cases - main Scenario design test cases accordingly.
