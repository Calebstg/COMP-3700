Our software mainly served two groups of people. On the left side is the normal user group. They can find and choose the service they need online. On the right side is the merchant group. They will receive the order from the normal user group and provide the required services. However, the merchant group can also modify their products and services information and introduction. The user will log in to their account and decide what service they would like to access, then the merchants will provide those services to the user, and the user can provide feedback on the aspect of the service that they used. We also can provide services without login, but that will lose some customized settings like "Guess what you like ", or some discounts for both groups of people.
