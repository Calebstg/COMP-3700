Testing plan (Partcial of the prototype)

1: Review of the use case model

2: Make sure that our use case logically clear and the system is perfomed well

3: Inspect the normal workflow in the system, which will also check the integrity of our APP's functions.

4: Make sure that some of the medical part is testable, because medical information is the top 1 secret and privacy of our client. 
our payment option like paypal and credit card are not testable because of the security reason.

5: check the "explorer" function is testable. The most important thing is secure our clients' private information.

6: After all above steps checked, we are ready to make the test case.

7: The test cases for each normal flow (i.e. login, items list and customer choosing etc.)

8: We compare our use cases - main Scenario design test cases accordingly.
